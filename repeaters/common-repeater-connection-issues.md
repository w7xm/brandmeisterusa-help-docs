# Repeater Connection Issues

### **Common things to look for when seeing errors or not able to connect to a Master Server.**

* [ ] Make sure you are not using Master 3101 - This is being decommission, choose any other USA Master Server.\

* [ ] Verify your Repeater Call Sign is listed first followed by any details such as site name or location. Example   W1AW - 1 or W1AW/R or W1AW ARRL HQ.\

* [ ] Verify your Repeater Call Sign and 6-Digit ID is the same as registered with RadioID.net. You may change the call sign at RadioID if not correct or on the Repeater in the Call Sign/Radio Alias fields to match. \

* [ ] MMDVM Repeaters must now set a device password in the Sysop Dashboard, see [Device Password](sysop-dashboard/device-password.md). This password is then entered into your Repeater either as hotspot security in pi-star or password in MMDVMHost.&#x20;
