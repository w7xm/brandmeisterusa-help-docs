# Frequency Details

Frequency information is provided from the Repeater itself and is not configurable via the Sysop Dashboard. If you see a wrong frequency for your repeater you will need to review the configuration in your CPS or device. You may turn off / disconnect  your repeater from the master server for a period of 1 to 2 minutes and then connect again to allow the master server to update information as this may be cached when you last connected.&#x20;
