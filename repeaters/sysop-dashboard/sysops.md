### Not seeing repeater in dashboard or My Repeater.

Here are some typical reasons not initially seeing your sysop rights to a repeater.

* You may need to log out and log back in for the profile to update with your new assigned rights.
* You may need to refresh your browser or cache for it to show.
* You have not been provided with the sysop rights as of yet and will need to request access if not done so already by the repeater owner/trustee or is till in progress being added by the BM Admin Team.&#x20;
