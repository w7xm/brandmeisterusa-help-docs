# Static Talk Groups

Static talk groups allow for specific talk groups to be set static/active meaning any traffic which becomes available will be sent to the repeater. Be careful of not adding to many static talk group for your users as they might at time cause some busy talk groups to monopolize the repeater/timeslot with traffic. A good general number is 3 or less static talk groups. Some users will dedicate Timeslot 2 to only 1 or 2 statics and might place most of other statics on Timeslot 1.
