# Create a Talk Group

## Overview

Talk groups on BrandMeister follow the MCC - Mobile Country Code. For example, USA Talk Groups begin with a 3. Talk groups which start with a 9 are assigned as Global Talk groups. More info about MCC can be found at | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_country_code) | [ITU](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.212)

Talk groups typically are labeled as topics or activities (such as POTA, YOTA, etc.), regional (such as state, city, worldwide, etc.), or user's groups (such as clubs, or users of a product or open-source project). Manufacture/Vendor specific are not allowed and will not be created.&#x20;

## 5-Digit Talk groups

{% hint style="warning" %}
As of May 2020, 5 Digit Talk groups are no longer being labeled/issued in the USA due to the limited number of talk groups available. See options below which are available to use.

## Use Your 7-Digit Radio ID

Users may use their RadioID.net issued radio ID as a talk group. Please only use your registered ID and don't pick one that you think is empty. (If your group has a club call you may also register for a 7-digit ID and use that as a talk group).&#x20;

#### Steps to begin using your ID as a Talk Group:

1. Program your radio by adding the 7-Digit Radio ID as a Group Call using the CPS Program.
2. Label it as you see fit in the CPS as this will show on your radio Display.
3. Provide the 7-Digit to others to program into their respective radios.&#x20;
4. Finally key up and test it out.

## Use Your Repeater 6-Digit Radio ID

Repeater Owners may use their 6-Digit Radio ID which is used for the repeater ID as a talk group. Please only use your registered 6-digit Repeater ID and don't pick one that you think is empty. You are able to use the 6-digit ID for both the ID for the repeater and as a talk group.&#x20;

#### Steps to begin using your ID as a Talk Group:

1. Program your radio by adding the 6-Digit Radio ID as a Group Call using the CPS Program.
2. Label it as you see fit in the CPS as this will show on your radio Display.
3. Provide or post the 6-Digit to others to program into their respective radios.&#x20;
4. Finally key up and test it out.
