# Connecting Hotspots

### Steps to connecting a hotspot to BrandMeister

The following is the general steps to connecting a hotspot (MMDVM Host, Pi-Star, OpenSpot, DVMega) to BrandMeister. For specific settings/configurations please visit the corresponding information as noted in red with links to the individual articles.

1. **Have a 7-digit Radio ID assigned** to you and your call sign. See [http://radioID.net](http://radioid.net) to setup a radio ID.\

2. **Setup your BrandMeister Dashboard Account** by registering at http://brandmeister.network and clicking on Register at the top right. See [register-for-an-account.md](../../dashboard/register-for-an-account.md "mention")\

3. **Set your Hotspot Security password** for the Radio ID you will use on your hotspot in BrandMeister SelfCare. See [hotspot-security.md](../../dashboard/hotspot-security.md "mention")\

4. **Configure your Hotspot** by selecting the master, entering in your hotspot password. See the specific hotspot connection information ([Pi-Star](pi-star-mmdvm/), [OpenSpot](openspot-shark-rf.md), [BlueDV](bluedv-megadv.md))\

5. **Configure your DMR Radio** to communicate with the hotspot. Generally, Radio and Hotspots need to be set to the same frequency, color code and talk groups setup you wish to communicate on using the CPS and uploading it into the radio.&#x20;

As of March 2021, all users are required to set a HotSpot Security Password when connecting hotspots worldwide. USA Master servers have been required since December 2020.&#x20;
