# Hotspot Connection Issues

### **Common things to look for when seeing errors or not able to connect to a Master Server.**

* [ ] Make sure you are not using Master 3101 - This was decommissioned in 2021, choose any other USA Master Server.\

* [ ] Check the [Device Logs](../../dashboard/device-logs.md) on the BrandMeister Dash for any errors being reported. \

* [ ] Verify you are entering your Hotspot Security Password Properly. (This is not the same password you log into BrandMeister selfcare.). See [Setting HotSpot Security](../../dashboard/hotspot-security.md).\

* [ ] Verify your call sign and radio ID are registered and are entered correctly into the hotspot. Call Sign and Radio ID must match the Radio ID registration.  \

* [ ] If you recently changed your call sign, you will need to register for a new Brandmeister account. See [Call Sign Change](../../dashboard/callsign-change.md).\

* [ ] If you recently made a change to your Radio ID on RadioID.net and have a 1xxxxxx ID, you will need to request for a new radio ID as 1xxxxx based IDs will not be updated or imported into Brandmeister. See [RadioID not Updating on BrandMeister](../../dashboard/radio-id-information-not-updating.md).\

* [ ] Make sure your call sign is entered correctly. For those which have a Zero in your call make sure you typed a zero and not the letter O. And for those with a number 1 in your call make sure you typed a number 1 and not the letter L or I.\

* [ ] If you are using Pi-Star make sure you are running the latest version by performing an upgrade/update in your configuration. Visit the pi-star forums for steps on how to upgrade/update.\

* [ ] If you are using DMR Gateway would suggest to try connecting with DMR Host (using the first drop down and choosing a master server using pi-star based software).\

* [ ] If you insist on using DMR Gateway then make sure you have selected the BrandMeister Network Enable Radio Button. \

* [ ] If this is a simplex hotspot make sure you are using a simplex channel\

* [ ] If this is a duplex hotspot use different Receive and Transmit Frequencies.\

* [ ] If using Pi-Star software make sure all fields requiring information is entered correctly. Including the Longitude and Latitude as the correct information entered correctly. (is a missing a decimal, entered correct values, etc.).\

* [ ] If using Pi-Star software you may consider a fresh load (reinstall) of the software. Sometimes SD Cards get corrupt and or some sort of configuration is not saving/working and by refreshing the software may help to resolve any issues you may be experiencing. \

* [ ] **If using Pi-Star base product:** If none of the above resolved your issue please consult the pi-star forums or vendor of product purchased from for further assistance. Here is a list of resources for the [Pi-Star Software](../connecting-hotspots/pi-star-mmdvm/pi-star-support-options.md). \

* [ ] **If using a DVSwitch based Product**: If none of the above resolved your issues pleas~~e~~ consult the DVSwitch or vendor of product purchased from for further assistance.
