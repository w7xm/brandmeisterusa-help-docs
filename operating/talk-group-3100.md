# Talk Group 3100

The intent of this talk group is a place for **USA Based Amateur Radio Operators** to have a channel to call to other USA based stations, ask questions, have general conversations and of course use as a calling channel to find other hams to communicate with.

This talk group is bridged with several CBridge systems in the USA. This talk group is fairly popular and is carried by a large number of repeaters and a large number of hotspot users.&#x20;

All Amateur Radio Stations are welcome to talk on this channel. **We ask non-USA based Stations** when making a call and have established communication with a station to please move to a TAC or another talk, specially when it is another non-USA based station. This will free up the talk group to allow other USA based stations to make a call.&#x20;

**This channel is a DMR only mode talk group.** Bridges to other modes are not permitted. This also includes any devices (hotspots, repeaters, etc.) which are not DMR Based are not permitted.&#x20;
