# Operating Etiquette

BrandMeister is a worldwide platform allowing Repeaters, Hotspots and other applications to centrally connect and communicate in real-time for amateur radio operators.

These are some general tips/guidance on how to navigate and operate on the network.&#x20;

1. **Be courteous and respectful** to fellow amateur radio operators while communication on the network.\

2. **Be mindful of your language** and know there can be many ears listening, even young ones.\

3. **Listen and Pause**... allow space between your conversations to allow others to join into the conversation and to allow hotspots or repeaters to disconnect from a talk group. A good practice is between 2 and 5 seconds. \

4. **Minimize highly charged conversations** such as politics and religions. Some talk groups might be more open to politics and religions but would recommend listening and practicing common sense when talking about highly charged topics. \

5. **Move to a TAC or Local Talk Group** when using a busy or high profile talk group. Be mindful of your communication time and suggest to move to a TAC or Local talk group if the conversation is going to go long. \

6. **Be Mindful of the Talk Group Label** as this will suggest the topic or region it was designated for. Some are meant to be used for a region and when outside stations utilize the talk group be mindful and respective of its usage and time. For example , there should be no instances of two or more outside stations use a talk group designated for another region.\

7. **Statewide Talk Groups** generally in the USA are meant to be calling channels and or short conversations and should move to a local TAC channel when possible. Generally a 10 minute rule exists before some monitoring might join your conversation to politely ask you to move to another talk group. Be mindful these statewide talk groups might be set static on a large number of repeaters statewide. Nets are acceptable on state wide talk groups.&#x20;
