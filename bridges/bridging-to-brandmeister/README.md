# Bridging to BrandMeister

## General Information

Even though BrandMeister supports the ability to bridge to reflectors and servers **each Master Server Admin has discretion of reviewing and approving bridge connections**. Please be respectful and patient when requesting a bridge connection.&#x20;

### USA Master Server Bridging Rules

* **Do not re-bridge talk group**(s) provided to your bridge. Any bridge connection which shows re-bridging to another server(s) will be disconnected without notice.
* **No Peer Bridging.** Peer Bridging is defined as the use of either the MMDVM or DM protocols by using a hotspot or other software which uses MMDVM or DM protocol to bridge reflectors or servers. Please request the appropriate bridging protocol (OpenBridge, XLX Interlink, etc.) when wishing to bridge talk groups to BrandMeister. &#x20;
* **Review of Bridge and/or Connection status** which do not show traffic of more than 60 days or is not showing connected may be disconnected / removed without notice. Please monitor your servers/reflectors to ensure they are online and operating properly.&#x20;
* **New Bridges** will only be provided up to 5 Talk groups which are hosted by BrandMeister (see below on what can be provided)

### What can or cannot be Bridged

* **5 Digit, 6 Digit and 7 Digit Talk** Groups may be provided if you are part of the group, it is your personal Radio ID or Repeater ID or received permission of the originator of the talk group.
