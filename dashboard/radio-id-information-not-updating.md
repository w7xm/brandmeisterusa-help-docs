# Radio ID Not Updating BM

The reason your ID / information has not updated in the BrandMeister database is likely to have one of the 11xxxxx DMR numbers issued by [http://RadioID.net](http://radioid.net) in the wrong MCC. The numbers were allowed to continue to work but BrandMeister will no longer import or update them.&#x20;

You need to go to your Radio ID account and request a replacement ID. There is a button to do that and it will issue you a 31xxxxx number. Once it is updated BM will import the ID and callsign information.

If you recently changed your call sign please view the [Callsign Change](callsign-change.md) steps (skip to step 3.) to continue with the remaining portions of what is required. \
