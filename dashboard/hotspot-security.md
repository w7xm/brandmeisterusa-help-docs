# HotSpot Security

All MMDVM or Homebrew (hotspots) devices connecting to BrandMeister USA must have a password set in the selfcare. Hotspot security helps to protect users from others connecting with your registered ID.

{% hint style="info" %}
Passwords: May be 20 characters or less and should not include special characters. Also be aware if you do copy and paste passwords you may also copy extra characters such as a space. Would recommend if possibly to manually type your passwords both in the selfcare and hotspots.&#x20;
